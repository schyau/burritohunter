BurritoHunter
=============

Burritos, at your fingertips.  

BurritoHunter is a Google Maps and Yelp API mashup that allows users to quickly build and save a list of POIs.  A proof of concept was submitted on July 17th for Blackboard Mobile's hackathon resulting in a 4th place finish!  and a $20 gift card for Peet's Coffee.  

It's been about 2 months since our original proof of concept, and we've made a ton of improvements to the app.  We still have a long way to go but we're working hard at it.  Here are some updated screen shots as of 9/10.

Still far from complete, and still an exciting challenge!  Please check back often to track the progress of BurritoHunter.
