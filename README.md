BurritoHunter
=============

Burritos, at your fingertips.  

BurritoHunter is a Google Maps and Yelp API mashup that allows you to quickly build and save a list of places you'd like to check out.  A proof of concept was submitted on July 17th for Blackboard Mobile's hackathon resulting in a 4th place finish!  and a $20 gift card for Peet's Coffee.  

Since then, we've been hard at work to provide a real production version to be released on the Google Play Store.  It's taken a lot longer to release than we initially thought.  But that's expected; this is both of our first times building a production app, so we've had some delays with redesigns and mental setbacks to deal with.  But we're hard at work to see to it that it does go live.  Whatever the case, it's been an amazing four months (and counting).  Anyway, enough of me ranting...

Here's a quick tutorial on how it works!

Search for places you'd like to checkout.  Burritos is our favorite test string, but you'll find that this app works for anything and everything, like candy corn or pogo sticks.  You can quickly snipe the good places by looking at our color coded rating system, or use the slide-out screen on the left to look for location titles (along with their actual FourSquare rating).  Once you've compiled a list of places you'd like to check out, you're read to save!

Swipe right to access the list of places you've saved.  Select the one you'd like to review, and observe the list of saved places that you customized earlier!  You can then select the icon at the bottom to view these places back in the map.



As you can see, there's just a little more work to be done before it's finished, so expect an imminent (and eminent!) release. Please check back often to track the progress of BurritoHunter.
