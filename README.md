BurritoHunter
=============

Burritos, at your fingertips.  

BurritoHunter is a Google Maps and Yelp API mashup that allows users to quickly build and save a list of POIs.  A proof of concept was submitted on July 17th for Blackboard Mobile's hackathon resulting in a 4th place finish!  and a $20 gift card for Peet's Coffee.

We are in the process of redoing the entire code and design to launch a production version to the Play Store.  Here are some screenshots displaying our progress:

Definitely far from complete, but still an exciting challenge!  Please check back often to track the progress of BurritoHunter.
